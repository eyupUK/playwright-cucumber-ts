## ‚úÖ Pros of Playwright

### üîÑ 1. Cross-browser support
Supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (Safari engine)

All bundled with Playwright‚Äîno need for separate browser drivers

### ‚ö° 2. Fast and Reliable
Headless mode is very fast

Built-in retry logic and automatic waiting for elements

### üîç 3. Powerful Automation Features
Support for multi-tab, multi-context, and iFrame interactions

Can intercept and mock network requests

Supports file uploads, downloads, geolocation, permissions, etc.

### üß™ 4. Built-in Test Runner
Comes with @playwright/test, no need for Jest/Mocha unless you want to

Parallel test execution by default

Supports test retries, timeouts, and screenshots on failure

### üåç 5. Supports Modern Frameworks
Works well with TypeScript, JavaScript, and can integrate with BDD tools like Cucumber

Can be used with React, Angular, Vue, etc.

### üì∏ 6. Rich Debugging Tools
npx playwright codegen for generating code by recording actions

Trace Viewer with full execution trace and screenshots

PWDEBUG=1 for debugging in slow motion

### üß© 7. API Testing Support
Can be used to send and validate API requests alongside UI tests

## ‚ùå Cons of Playwright
### üß± 1. Steeper Learning Curve (for beginners)
More powerful = more things to configure and understand

Beginners may feel overwhelmed compared to Cypress or Selenium IDE

### üîß 2. Limited Ecosystem for BDD
Official Cucumber integration isn't native‚Äîyou need custom setup for Cucumber + Playwright

Requires knowledge of both tools to use together smoothly

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Headless Testing Gotchas
Some UI bugs may not show in headless mode; tests can pass headless but fail visually

May need to run in headed mode occasionally for visual checks

### üì¶ 4. Large Installation Size
Comes bundled with browser binaries, which increases project size (300MB+)

### üìâ 5. Not as Widely Adopted Yet as Selenium
Selenium has a longer history and broader support in enterprise projects

Some legacy systems and CI setups still prefer Selenium
